# Personal Coding Challenges & Scripts

This repository is a personal collection of Python scripts, serving as a log of my solutions to various online coding challenges, algorithm practice, and miscellaneous automation tools. The code within represents a journey through different problems and platforms, showcasing a variety of problem-solving techniques.

**_Most of this code is very outdated as it was written in my freshman year in college_**

## Contents Overview

The repository is broadly organized into several categories based on the source of the challenges or the purpose of the script.

### Codewars Solutions

- **1 Kyu:** `Sliding_Puzzle_Solver.py`, `Faberge_easter_eggs_crush_test_[linear].py`
- **3 Kyu:** `The_Millionth_Fibonacci_Kata.py`, `Last_digit_of_a_huge_number.py`, `Binomial_expansion.py`
- **4 Kyu:** `TCP_finite_state_machine.py`, `Recover_secret_string.py`, `The_observed_pin.py`
- **5-7 Kyu:** A variety of solutions covering fundamental algorithms and data structures.

### Python Challenge Solutions

Solutions for the puzzles from the classic [Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/).

- Scripts are named `python_challenge_X.py`, corresponding to the level number.
- These challenges often involve web requests, image manipulation, and creative problem-solving.

### Web Scraping & Automation

A collection of scripts designed to automate tasks, interact with websites, or extract data.

- `Automated_eclass_login.py`: A Selenium script to log into the Upnet e-class platform.
- `play_music_youtube.py`: Searches and plays the first result for a song on YouTube using Selenium.
- `send_fb_message.py`: An experimental script to automate sending messages on Facebook.
- `simple_link_get.py`: A simple script using `requests` and `regex` to extract all links from a webpage.

### Data Science & Algorithms

Implementations of various algorithms and data science concepts.

- `TOP-K_Most_Similar_Documents.py`: Calculates and ranks document similarity using cosine similarity.
- `neural_test.py`: An experimental implementation of a simple neural network and text preprocessing using `pandas` and `nltk`.
- `cluster_hierarchy.py`: Uses `scipy` and `matplotlib` to generate and display a dendrogram for hierarchical clustering.
- `Pancake_sort.py`: An implementation of the pancake sorting algorithm.

### Hacking & CTF Challenges

Scripts written to solve challenges from platforms like [HackThis!!](https://www.hackthis.co.uk/).

- `Hack_this_captcha1.py`: Uses `pytesseract` for OCR to attempt to solve a CAPTCHA challenge.
- `Hack_this_coding_1.py`: Solves a coding challenge by sorting a list of words.

### Miscellaneous Scripts

A variety of other utility scripts and practice problems.

- `Roman_to_number.py`: A script to convert Roman numerals to integers.
- `move_files.py`: A utility to organize files into a specified folder.
- `word_counter.py`: A simple script to count words in a text file.

## Technologies Used

- **Primary Language:** Python 3
- **Libraries:**
  - `requests` for HTTP requests
  - `selenium` for browser automation
